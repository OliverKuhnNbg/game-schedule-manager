Tutorial Base - clean project set up
https://dzone.com/articles/angular-app-state-management-with-ngrx

1. Create an Angular App With Angular CLI

- Let's create a new Angular Application 
```
ng new angular-state-management --style=scss --routing=false
```

- It will create all the required files and install the dependencies. This will take a few minutes.

2. Load the Project Into the IDE (I'm Using IntelliJ IDEA)

3. Run the App

- Let's run the app created by the CLI, just to make sure everything has been created correctly so far.

```
cd angular-state-management 
```
```
npm start
```

- Check that the app is running on http://localhost:4200/

4. Install NgRx and Tools

NgRx Schematics provides scaffolding. NgRx commands get integrated into the Angular CLI, and most of the NgRx elements can be created using angular CLI. So, let's add NgRx Schematics. (You can use a new terminal window or exit out from the running angular app by pressing the Ctrl+C key )
```
ng add @ngrx/schematics
```

Configure the Schematics so that NgRx commands are available in Angular CLI by default.
```
ng config cli.defaultCollection @ngrx/schematics
```

Letâ€™s install the NgRx,  dependencies, and dev-tools now.
```
npm install --save @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/entity @ngrx/store-devtools 
```

Notice that package.json has been updated.
